Project focusing on BigData tools for Machine Learning.
Overview:
Predicting tweet sentiments about World Cup 2022 using Databricks, AWS s3, Athena and QuickSight as well as simple ML models. 
Objective
Exploring DataBricks Community Edition capabilities to wrangle 1 million rows of data and utilize a variety of tools to encourage understandign of their use cases.


**Models used in this project:**

Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
Naive Bayes

**GridSearch done on:**

Logistic Regression

**Sampled GridSearch done on:**

Random Forest

Pipeline was used for the final model

**Conclusions**
- ML in Spark heavily relies on how many cores are available in the cluster
- Tree-based algorithms are much more computationally exprensive and were not able to predict accurately due to lack of depth
- Both linear models (LR and NB) have performed much better in this specific scenario, producing higher scores
